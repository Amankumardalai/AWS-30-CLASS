# IAM

>
IAM stands for Identity and Access Management, and it is a web service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) to securely control access to AWS resources. IAM enables you to manage users, groups, and permissions within your AWS environment. With IAM, you can create and manage AWS users and groups, and control their access to AWS services and resources.

Users:
IAM users represent individual people or services within your organization who interact with AWS. Each user has a unique username and security credentials (password or access keys) associated with their account. Users can be assigned specific permissions to access AWS resources.

Groups:
Groups are collections of IAM users. By organizing users into groups, you can manage permissions collectively. Instead of attaching policies to individual users, you attach policies to groups, making it easier to scale permissions management for teams or departments.

Roles:
IAM roles define a set of permissions for making AWS service requests. Roles are not associated with a specific user or group; instead, they are assumed by entities such as IAM users, AWS services, or even federated users (users authenticated by an external identity provider). Roles are often used for granting temporary permissions to services or applications.

Policies:
IAM policies are JSON documents that specify permissions. Policies can be attached to users, groups, or roles to define what actions are allowed or denied on what AWS resources. Policies are flexible and can be fine-tuned to control access at a granular level.

Permissions:
Permissions in IAM are based on the principle of least privilege, meaning that entities (users, groups, or roles) should have only the minimum permissions necessary to perform their tasks. IAM enables you to grant permissions for specific actions on specific resources.

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):
MFA adds an extra layer of security to user sign-ins and to sensitive operations. IAM supports virtual MFA devices or hardware MFA devices for enhanced security.

Access Keys:
IAM users can have access keys, which consist of an access key ID and a secret access key. Access keys are used for programmatic access to AWS services and are commonly used with the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) or SDKs.

Identity Federation:
IAM supports identity federation, allowing you to grant temporary access to users authenticated by an external identity provider (IdP) such as Active Directory or social identity providers.

IAM Policies Language:
IAM policies use a JSON-based language to express permissions. The policy language allows you to specify conditions, resource-level permissions, and other advanced access controls.

Audit and Logging:
IAM provides features for auditing and logging, including AWS CloudTrail integration. CloudTrail records API calls made on your account, providing visibility into user activity and changes made to your IAM resources.

Fine-Grained Access Control:
IAM enables fine-grained access control through policy conditions, allowing you to specify circumstances under which policies are in effect (e.g., time-based access, IP-based access).
